# Notational ls Usage
**NOTE**: I alias 'nls' to 'python nls.py' (alias nls='python path_to/nls.py')

* **nls** - prints the equivalent of ls, with notes for each file if it exists
* **nls bootstrap** - initializes the .nls file with everything so you can mass edit them in an editor
* <b>nls [some file] [some description]</b> - saves \[some description\] (quotes optional) as the note for [somefile]
